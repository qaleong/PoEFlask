## __Features__
A program that can automate flask presses for path of exile.

Every cycle it randomly chooses a time value between the times that you enter so the time between flask uses are always random.

Checks to make sure path of exile is the active window before pressing the flask button.

Allows the user to disable flask timers not currently in use.
